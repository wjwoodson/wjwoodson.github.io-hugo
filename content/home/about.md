# About Me

~~Information Security Analyst~~ ~~InfoSec Person~~ ~~infosec thought thinker~~
Person doing security things.

I am currently a `Senior Security Engineer` at [ThreatX](https://threatx.com), previously employed at other places in slightly different roles. I enjoy participating in security conferences and pretending I know how to perform and/or present research.
