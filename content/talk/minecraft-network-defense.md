# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this talk we will discuss the application of defensive concepts via the game Minecraft, work on tying results in the game back to real world network defense, and provide tools and ideas for setting up your very own security education program: Defend your network against cyber threats in a multiplayer Minecraft scenario. Build a firewall to keep attackers out of a defensive perimeter. Use cyber defense tools to stop the bad guys, and go hunting for cyber threat intelligence. But watch out, sophisticated attackers might already be inside your network!"
